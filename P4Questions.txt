1. (2 points) How did you represent a board in your code?  Why did you choose this repesentation?


2. (3 points) Describe the hash function you used.  
How well does your hash function distribute the game boards in the hash table?  
Provide an analysis of your hash table statistics to support your claim.


3. (5 points) At some point your smart player will have to decide to choose a 
previous move that has led to win or try a new move which may evetually lead to a

player should repeat a previous move or try a new move?
How did changing this criteria affect the learning curve of the smart player.
